# DragonMind on the Web

Welcome to DragonMind, a game where you play as the hero of a town in the middle of a crisis. You have the power to change how the game ends when interacting with the villagers, so choose wisely!

## How to Play
All controls are displayed in game. We use a common PC gaming set of controls. You must enter a password, provided by the research team, to play our demo. You can see the demo here: https://doctorhenry.github.io/DragonMindWeb/

## How to obtain the password
Please email Dr John Henry (john.henry@mmu.ac.uk) and Dr Martin Turner (m.turner@mmu.ac.uk) if you wish to gain access to the demo. The demo is password protected as it forms part of a funding bid that will allow us to extend on what we have produced so far, to a bigger game with more exciting ways to interact with the story.
